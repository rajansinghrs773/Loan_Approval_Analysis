Project Title - Loan Approval Analysis 
The primary objective of this project is to conduct an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to vehicle insurance. Through this analysis, I gained valuable insights into the patterns, trends, and factors influencing insurance claims. The project encompasses various aspects of data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis.
In this project, I had  performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to home loan approval. The dataset is sourced from Skill Circle and contains valuable information for analysis. The primary focus of this project is on data exploration and visualization, machine learning techniques are not required.

Key Highlights:-
Explored the distribution of key numeric variables using histograms and box plots.
Analyzed categorical variables through bar charts and pie charts to visualize frequency distributions.
Investigated relationships between pairs of numeric variables using scatter plots and pair plots.
Explored correlations between numeric variables and visualized them using a heatmap.
Created stacked bar charts to showcase the distribution of categorical variables across multiple categories.
Utilized geospatial analysis (optional) to identify regional trends if geographical information was present in the dataset.

Conclusions:

Identified a strong positive correlation between ApplicantIncome and LoanAmount, suggesting that higher income tends to result in larger loan amounts.
Explored the impact of Education and Property Area on loan amounts through visualizations.
Highlighted the influence of Credit History on loan approval.
This project showcases my skills in data exploration, visualization, and analysis, providing valuable insights for decision-making in the domain of loan approvals.
